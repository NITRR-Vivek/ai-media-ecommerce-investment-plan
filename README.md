# Ai-media-ecommerce-investment-plan
## Problem Statement
> 
> An AI-driven media investment plan for e-commerce businesses. Based on this analysis, re-allocate the budget across various paid media channels to optimize customer acquisition and conversion rates.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We are first making our solution and uploaded as `code1.ipynb` as you can see but a day after uploading it, a Team named [Dual Delight](https://github.com/SAGARGAUD01/AI-Driven-Media-Investment-Plan-) copied the whole project and make it as their own work. so we are diappointed and then again started working fresh and made this project which you can see in `Dazzle-DAV.ipynb` file.

## Our Solution Approach 
> to see our project please open `Dazzle-DAV.ipynb`.
- Data Collection and Preprocessing.
- Data Exploration and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Analysing the various parameters and customer's behaviour.
- Analysing trends and patterns to optimize the conversion rates.
- Feature Engineering.
- Apply machine learning techniques to analyze the processed data.
- Finetuning the Parameters of the Best Performing Model.
- Based on the insights gained from the machine learning analysis, reallocate the budget across different paid media channels adhering to the constraints.
- Document the entire process, including data processing, algorithm development, assumptions made, and results obtained.

## Future works

1. Enhanced Machine Learning Model for Budget Allocation
    - Implement a dynamic system where the model adjusts budget allocations in real-time based on ongoing campaign performance.
    - Set up pipelines and integrate the ML models into an automated system
2. User Behavior Analysis and Segmentation
    - urther analyze the clusters identified from the PCA and KMeans results to understand the specific behaviors
    - Conduct a time-series analysis on the data to see how user behaviors change over time and adapt marketing strategies accordingly.
3. Advanced Feature Engineering
    - Create new features that capture the temporal aspects of user behavior
4. Long-Term Strategic Planning
    - Use the insights gained from the current models to predict future trends in user behavior and ad performance
